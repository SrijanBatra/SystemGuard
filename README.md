# SystemGuard üíÇ

System Guard is a Flask app designed to monitor server stats such as CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network. It also provides real-time monitoring capabilities which can be useful for system administrators, developers, and DevOps engineers to keep track of their server's performance and troubleshoot issues. The app uses the `psutil` library to retrieve system stats and the `speedtest-cli` library to perform a network speed test.

## Features üöÄ

- Lightweight, open-source, and free to use with a straightforward installation process.
- Capable of monitoring core server metrics like CPU, memory, disk usage, and network traffic.
- Includes built-in security features such as authentication for login, logout, and signup.
- Administrators can manage user accounts by creating, updating, or deleting users.
- Admin-level access is required for configuring settings, managing users, and adjusting security and notification - preferences.
- Historical performance data can be viewed as charts, aiding in trend analysis.
- Supports network speed testing directly from the server.
- Provides the ability to terminate resource-heavy processes with a single command.
- Real-time server metric monitoring keeps data consistently updated.
- The interface is responsive and optimized for various devices including mobile, tablets, and desktops.
- The system can automatically update to the latest version to simplify maintenance.
- Installation can be done quickly via a bash script for easy setup.
- Notifications are sent to users and admins when a process is manually terminated.
- Offers website monitoring tasks that trigger email alerts when a website becomes unavailable.
- Configurable email alerts for various actions across the server.
- Role-based dashboards tailored for Developer, Admin, IT Manager, and Manager roles (upcoming feature).
- Option to download historical data in CSV format for detailed analysis (upcoming feature).
- Server status monitoring with alerts for server downtime or recovery (upcoming feature).

## How does installation work? ü§î

The installation process is straightforward and can be completed in a few steps. The user needs to run a bash script that installs the required dependencies, sets up the database, create a conda environment, and add flask server to the cron job. The user can then access the SystemGuard web interface by visiting the server's IP address or domain name.

## Why not use a Docker image? üê≥

A Docker image has not been created for this project because it requires access to the host machine in order to retrieve server stats. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain server stats from within a Docker container.
