Profile Management
==================

The **Profile Management** section in SystemGuard allows users to view and manage their account details, update settings, and perform actions like enabling super admin privileges.

User Information
----------------

In this section, users can view their basic profile details:

- **Username**: Displays the user's unique identifier in the system.
- **Email**: Displays the user's email address. This is used for account communication and notifications.
- **User Level**: Displays the userâ€™s access level (e.g., `admin`). Admins have full system access, while regular users have limited access.
- **Email Alerts**: Displays whether email alerts are enabled (`True` if enabled).
- **Role**: Displays the user's role in the organization (e.g., `Software Developer`).

Profile Actions
---------------

Users have several actions they can perform within the Profile Management section:

- **Edit Profile**: Allows users to update their personal information, including their email, role, and other relevant details.
- **Change Password**: Enables users to change their current password by entering their existing password and specifying a new one.
- **Delete Profile**: This option allows users to delete their profile from the system. This action is irreversible and should be done with caution.
- **Logout**: Logs the user out of the SystemGuard dashboard, ending the current session.

Super Admin Privileges
----------------------

- **Enter Sudo Password**: For admin users, this option allows you to elevate privileges by entering a sudo password. This is necessary for performing critical actions that require additional authentication.
- **Enable Super Admin**: This option enables the super admin mode, granting the user the highest level of system access for tasks such as user management, system configurations, and critical system updates.
