User Settings
=============

The **User Settings** section provides options to customize and manage user-specific behavior and performance in SystemGuard. These settings allow you to define parameters for speed tests and dashboard refresh intervals.

Speedtest Cooldown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Speedtest Cooldown** setting determines the minimum time (in minutes) that must pass before a user can initiate another speedtest. This helps prevent excessive testing and ensures system resources are used efficiently.

- **Cooldown Period**: Set the number of minutes required between speedtests.

Number of Speedtests Allowed per Hour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Number of Speedtests Allowed per Hour** setting defines the maximum number of speedtests a user can perform within a one-hour period. This limit is essential for controlling bandwidth usage and avoiding network congestion.

- **Limit**: Specify the maximum number of speedtests allowed per user, per hour.

Refresh Interval
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Refresh Interval** setting controls the automatic refresh rate of the dashboard, specified in seconds. This allows you to determine how often the dashboard updates with the latest data, balancing performance and real-time information display.

- **Interval**: Set the refresh interval in seconds for automatic dashboard updates.
