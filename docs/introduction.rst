introduction
==============

System Guard is a Flask app designed to monitor server stats such as
CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network. It also provides real-time monitoring
capabilities which can be useful for system administrators, developers,
and DevOps engineers to keep track of their serverâ€™s performance and
troubleshoot issues. The app uses the ``psutil`` library to retrieve
system stats and the ``speedtest-cli`` library to perform a network
speed test.
